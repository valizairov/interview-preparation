# Daily prep for MAANG SWE interview

This repository is a collection of coding exercises, design patterns, and system design notes aimed at preparing for interviews at top tech companies (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google).  

The focus is on:
- **Algorithmic problem solving** (data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, etc.)
- **System design** (scalability, reliability, real-world tradeoffs)
- **Concurrency & race condition handling**
- **Behavioral & leadership principles** (interview-ready stories and examples)

---

## Contents

- `data-structures/` – Implementations and problems across arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash maps.
- `algorithms/` – Classic problems like palindrome checks, sorting, recursion, DP, and graph traversal.
- `system-design/` – Notes, diagrams, and case studies for distributed systems, caching, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
- `concurrency/` – Patterns and race condition scenarios with sample code.
- `behavioral/` – STAR-style responses and structured examples for leadership and collaboration.

---

## Approach

- Each problem includes:
  - A clear problem statement
  - Step-by-step solution or explanation
  - Code implementation
  - Complexity analysis (time & space)
- System design and concurrency sections include real-world analogies and tradeoffs.

---

## Goal

To maintain sharpness in both **fundamentals** and **scalable system thinking** while documenting progress in a structured and reusable format.
